## Compiling Stuff
1. Use Unity Version 2018.2.19, which can be found [here](https://unity.com/cn/releases/editor/whats-new/2018.2.19)
2. Download and Install the WebGL Build Add-on [Here](http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/06990f28ba00/TargetSupportInstaller/UnitySetup-WebGL-Support-for-Editor-2018.2.19f1.exe)
3. After all has been installed, open Unity, Sign In with your Unity ID, and press the ```Open a Project``` button and select the folder that contains the assets
4. Ignore some warnings because they definitely don't matter :)
5. Go to ```File -> Build Settings -> WebGL -> Switch Platforms```
> Recommended to change Screen Height to ```540```, instead of default ```600```
6. Press ```Build and Run``` to build the game and to preview it
> [!WARNING]
> If you get a ```Invaild Build Path``` error, try first making a folder at the root of your ```C:``` drive, and selecting that folder
7. Get the compilied files from whatever folder you chose to build to, which you can use to put into your website to host this game

Or you can download compilied files from the Releases tab if you're lazy
